# Blackjack_RL
Reinforcement Learning project for AI & ML course, based on Blackjack-v1 environment by Gymnasium.
Implements standard Deep Q-Learning Neural Network (DQN) and Tabluar Q-Learning algorithm for non deterministic environments.
Aim of the project is to evaluate the two methods (DQN and TabularQL) varying the hyperparameters of the Reinforcement Learning models: Learning rate, Discount factor, number of episodes, epsilon-greedy param variation.
